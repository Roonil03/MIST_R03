This was another challenge that I really attempted at solving, but had nothing working, and therefore I left it. I tried various combinations of repeatedly trying base64, to just trying to understand the inner workings of it and to make my own version by bit manipulation.

But absolutely nothing was working. It was really disheartening to see this, but due to the circumstances, I left this question as well.
