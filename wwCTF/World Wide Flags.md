In this challenge, we pretty much had to see the flags and identify them as fast as possible.

I tried various ways to find a fast and efficient way to solve it, including trying to see the JavaScript code that was present on the site to see if the answer was already stored in it.

That wasn't working, so I tried to manually do the flags until about the 7th flag where I realized that it would be really tough and really stupid to continue in that manner. So I just left for my teammates to solve that question.

However, none of us could properly devote the time that would be required for it <i>(due to the looming exam pressure)</i> and thus we also left this question.
