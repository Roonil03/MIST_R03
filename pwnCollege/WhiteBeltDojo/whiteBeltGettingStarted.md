# Getting Started Into the Dojo:

White belt:
1. VSC Workspace: The flag was already present when I ran the new workspace and started with the dojo's terminal. This was the flag that was present:
    ```
    pwn.college{YdUT6MsJVFZE9s9i3Y9uTeGKxuc.dZjM3MDLyYjMxkzW}
    ```
2. The challenge was quite simple, all we needed to do was interact with their virtual desktop and open the terminal... Then it was just a few instructions to get through and we have the flag: 
    ```
    pwn.college{MBd9DXmORuCnQeG8o-GE5Bxb-0B.ddjM3MDLyYjMxkzW}
    ```
3. This challenge was even simpler, because all we needed to do was interact with the VM's clipboard to extract data and get data from the clipboard, giving us the flag: 
    ```
    pwn.college{YfBiRdrXnuVsWlFhoTBdK4GVqJ7.dhjM3MDLyYjMxkzW}
    ```

4. This challenge taught the ability to restart challenges and start from scratch zero. Since the flag file disappears after typing in the wrong password, it was a good introductory into the ability to restart challenges

5. The challenge was to use their LLM -AI to ask for the password that was required in the terminal to get you across to the next challenge. After getting the password, we go to our VM and type in our passcode, to get the flag:
    ```
    pwn.college{8bHuLJCPGdQKmL7ywiGQLw_fGHm.dJjM0UDLyYjMxkzW}
    ```
6. This challenge required us to look into the various directories to find the flag that was present... so we had to run it in the /challenges/solve directory, making the flag instantly appear: 
    ```
    pwn.college{MUML77yyA8CFUWwiHY4_96Zg3Ga.dRzM4QDLyYjMxkzW}
    ```
7. This challenge required us to get the flag by running practice mode and everything... It took some time for us to get used to the entire thing, but at the same time it also took some time to understand the entire working of the entire challenge, but I found the flag in a few seconds after understanding what was working and what was not:
    ```
    pwn.college{I1wcMEhaztQ8TaCCEw75WjX9a3C.dBzM3MDLyYjMxkzW}
    ```

- The rest of the challenges was basics introduction into using linux and how to manipulate everything.
