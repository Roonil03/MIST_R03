# Hello Hackers
## Intro to Commands:
This was the first challenge in this entire thing, so time to get this started!

I started the webshell, and got started with the challenge:
```
hacker@hello~intro-to-commands:~$ whoami
hacker
hacker@hello~intro-to-commands:~$ 
```

then we were supposed to do this:
```
hacker@hello~intro-to-commands:~$ hello hacker
Success! Here is your flag:
pwn.college{E_XS-NegnLLAeetXSpyynqEBz7I.ddjNyUDLyYjMxkzW}
hacker@hello~intro-to-commands:~$ 
```
and thus the flag was found.
### Answer:
```
pwn.college{E_XS-NegnLLAeetXSpyynqEBz7I.ddjNyUDLyYjMxkzW}
```

## Intro to Arguments:
This time, we had to do something with echo.  
I started the virtual desktop again and was greeted with this:
```
hacker@hello~intro-to-arguments:~$ echo Hello Hackers!
Hello Hackers!
```
This was a simple exercise to use arguments when using linux commands.
Thus, I tried this:
```
hacker@hello~intro-to-arguments:~$ hello hackers
Success! Here is your flag:
pwn.college{wvKh1_LqIn4fK748LrvfnQpQqdY.dhjNyUDLyYjMxkzW}
```
and there is the flag!
### Answer:
```
pwn.college{wvKh1_LqIn4fK748LrvfnQpQqdY.dhjNyUDLyYjMxkzW}
```

## Command History:
This time, we are going to be using the shell history's stack to go through and see what are the previously used commands.
```
hacker@hello~command-history:~$ the flag is pwn.college{gNE6S0lwYLGQc-lrmfx_SkyNq6J.QX2MTM3EDLyYjMxkzW}
-bash: the: command not found
hacker@hello~command-history:~$ 
```
and there is the flag for this challenge!
### Answer:
```
pwn.college{gNE6S0lwYLGQc-lrmfx_SkyNq6J.QX2MTM3EDLyYjMxkzW}
```
