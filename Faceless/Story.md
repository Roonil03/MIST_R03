# Story - Faceless 2025
## Prologue:
Sirens blare, and the surrounding area is filled with officers and responders trying to gauge the situationâ€”a simple murder, with so much data missing. Forensics comes into the scene and watches in horror as a young girl lies dead on the floor, with a single bullet present at the temple of her head. Blood seems to flow out of it, and there is a video that seems to be playing on the phone.
Strange and absurd video, at least according to the Forensics team. They come back down to the station to make a report and come to hunt the player down.

The Player is part of a Cyber Cell that specialises in investigating and gaining information on individuals who may be involved in crimes. The Police and the Investigative Bureaus all rely on such cell divisions to aid in the process.

After making the Player and their team sign some forms, the Cyber Cell, consisting of three people, start their work.

Two senior members and a fresh intern, all ready and equipping themselves for the night, where they try their best to gain information on the individual, who is found out to be Ashna Shah.

## Level 1:
The first thing that the Cell gets is the video, which ends with "You're Next!". Not quite ominous for the current standard, but worth investigating, considering the death took place while the video was playing.

Ashna from her family did not seem like someone who was having enemies, so to have such an incident could mean two things to the Player.
1. Either she was hiding her alliance and mafia ties from everyone, and upon getting into trouble, she was shot dead
2. Due to the research work that she was doing, it was a possibility that she could be against some rival company that was against the research that she was doing.

All in all, the Player only had speculative and no confirmatory details.

All the Player could do was find the information required...

Upon exploring the YouTube video that she was watching, you come across a researcher by the name of Veer Reddy. Veer seemed like someone who loved to put a lot of information on the internet, and he seemed to be living the chill life. He was close friends with two people, he seemed to have bought his dream vehicle, and he was going on foreign trips for research.

This is exactly what contradicts the video that was put up on his channel.

An awkward name, with a strange message at the end, the Player's Cell tried finding some more information about the other two friends of Veer Reddy.

## Level 2:
After some time digging through the net, the Player comes to know the names of the three friends.
- Veer Reddy
- Jai Chopra
- Akash Malik

These three friends seemed to be into some strangely ominous research, with the topics in Quantum Physics they are researching called the Thanon Conversion.
From the various horror games that these individuals played, the information you've gathered on Akash's girlfriend, and finding information on the company that they are working for, Recherche de Superposition leads you nowhere.

While trying to pin the information onto a board, the Player and the other senior member just stare at the empty board... until the cute little intern comes and shows the Player some additional information that they found.

A clue to the mentor that these three were working under.

## Level 3:
The mentor seemed like an interesting person. On one hand, his wife was the manager of a dog cafe...
On the other hand, Shatrunjay Sinha was working on an obscure branch of Quantum Physics. There are no details as to what exactly this sort of research was contributing to, but all the Player can find out is a lot of papers and useless information.

The intern seemed to get irritated with the amount of information that the team was going to have to sift through, until the other senior member came and started getting summaries for the papers via tools...
Making the entire task much faster.

While researching the papers, you come across a new post that was put up by Jai and Akash, and try to track down the gaming accounts, you find out the Steam Account that belongs to Shatrunjay...

Linked to the Steam Account was a simple tutorial YouTube channel that taught the basics of Quantum Physics and Mechanics. By the tone of the voice, as well as the use of technology, it was pretty evident that the person seemed old, but was able to use current technology quite efficiently.

From this, you gather his WiFi password and some other addresses, but that all leads to a dead end after exploring it a little bit.

After spending more than 2 hours on this, the Player and his team backtrack to the YouTube video to see if there are any other hints that they can find to move further in this investigation.

## Level 4:
Seeing the comments of the first video, there's something peculiar that the Player's Teammate notices, a random comment that states 'Why her?'

The Player has no idea who this person may be, but information is information. Thus, the team ends up in the rabbit hole of finding information on a new individual called Raishid Patel.

This is what the team had gathered about Raishid:
- He was the Chief Research Officer at a place called the Pandemonium-Superlatif Facility
- He was the boyfriend of the late Ashna Shah
- The date of demise was found to be the 7th of April, which is two days before the date that was originally given to you
- There is an entire friend group that was close to Ashna who all supported the work that she was doing.
- The relationship between Raishid and Ashna was kept badly secret.
- They loved using the platform called Trust Cafe
- He was quite well-off, since he loved drinking from luxury brands of coffee, he stayed at a penthouse in Mumbai, and his dates seemed to be expensive as well.

All in all, the information that the team gathered on this individual seemed to be concerning, and it looked like a complete breakdown over the loss of his loved one.
This was the first close member that they could find who was not a blood relative of the deceased individual, but shared the same pain as them. The Player sympathises with this individual, but that also means that it was a dead end for the team, producing absolutely no results even after going so deep into this entire person.

That was all until the intern produces a name, that seemed to be far more interesting than the rest of these individuals.

## Level 5:
*Mira Shukla*  
A name that seems very common at first.  
She's the therapist assigned to Raishid after his mental trauma had gotten worse, and he was not showing up for work at the Research Facility. However, Mira is no ordinary therapist, since she shared a relationship with Raishid before Ashna, and that's the sole reason with which the Cell decides to investigate her deeper.

And that was a good call, surprisingly. The Player uncovers some jarring details, with strange novels put up on Webnovel, to the various pins that she has on her Pinterest board, you seem to raise your suspicion on the fact that you may actually be close to catching this individual.

After reading through the novels, it becomes evident that she hated the fact that Raishid left her for Ashna, and there are multiple instances in the story where she's been actively trying to kill Ashna in these stories.

*"This might be the first breakthrough that we might have"*, the two senior members think while staring into their screens, looking at the utter chaos that is present in this scenario,

That was their first initial evidence that they could use to try and arrest the killer.

They bring in Mira for questioning and try to understand how she might have been able to hire assassins to kill this person.
While being in complete denial that she was part of this plot of murder, her phone was confiscated and checked by the other Cell members.

She seemed to have absolutely no idea that this person had disappeared and was denying most of the allegations against her.

That was all until the other Senior Member came up to the Player and showed the chats that MIra had been having with a person called Pradyumna.

## Level 6:
Keeping her in the room still for questioning, the Cell decides to now plunge all their resources into uncovering the new information that was given to them. Via Pinterest chats, it was revealed that Mira has been chatting with a person called Praduymna Dangwal.

Praduymna seemed to be an active coder who had contributions to projects with other people. The main name that caught the team's eyes was Arjun Bhujiawalla. This man from Cumbum seemed to be holding a lot of secrets in plain sight, since commit messages and codes all contained messages that plotted some sort of mess. Along with Arjun, his brother Karn was found trying to gather information, and the team soon realises a glaring truth. This is no ordinary, simple killing, but a massive operation trying to kill this one person.

## Level 7:
This is where everyone in the team starts to panic...
A code to the Discord chats gets leaked, and piecing everything together on the board, it becomes evident.

Realising that Karn and Arjun are not just regular killers but hitmen or assassins for hire, that would pose a serious threat to the entire country.

The Player decides to red alert the station and provides them with the evidence that they currently have. Going from the various drop-off points that these individuals were working with to gain information on Ashna to assassinate her, to the hotels and places that these people were staying at, it was very clearly evident that no one was ready for a massive altercation between the Government Body and this high-scale Mafia effort.

All the Player can do, though, is just continue gathering evidence against these individuals.

Spotless Edge, the game that they were playing that had the coordinates to get the gun that they were using to kill this individual, the name of the person who delivered them the *parcel* or rather, the gun.

Everything seemed extremely murky.

The intern looks scared, so the Player tries their best to comfort the intern.

*"These are terrorists that we are dealing with, right? These are no simple humans. They are killing people for a living... I do not know if there's anything that can be done by us. What did she do wrong? Ashna Shah just seemed to die for no possible reason. Sure, it was the hitman who killed for the job that was given to him, and they seem to be working at this Laundry place called the Spotless Edge, but I don't think these people would- "*, the intern gets cut short by the Player; who seems to have found something interesting.

The Laundry Place where Karn works.

The place gets frequently contacted due to the dry cleaning required to remove all evidence.

## Level 8:
Every double job needs a primary distraction, and for these killers, it was none other than the Laundry Services provided by a person called Maya.

The CEO and manager of this service-store was Maya Mannaravalappil. She seemed to be heavily interested in cleaning up specific kinds of red stains from the regular chemicals that she seemed to order for her Laundry services, and pretty much masks all the that any normal individual would have.

After about 3 hours of trying to jot down all the marks onto the board, you realise that she doesn't just provide laundry services. She was the main Janitor of this operation.

This failed musician trying to make a business career was a massive discovery. The team now found out why it had taken them so long to uncover the truth about this entire incident. She had forgotten to clean up the body of Ashna, leaving massive evidence after the killing due to the short time and no chance to clean up the body.

Maya had managed to clean up so many bodies that the team was finding it difficult to pinpoint which of the missing people would have been part of their entire operation.

However, one thing was evident to them... This was no longer a local threat, but a national-level terrorist attack on multiple researchers and their operation seemed completely hidden to the public eye.

Discovering all this, and providing evidence for this operation, the Player informs the Chief about the team's finding and requests for some additional time.

Slowly, you start to uncover more details about this massive scheme, from the various operations that were handled to the base of operations in Dhareni and the shop where she would get her tools from.

Everything that would lead back to one person.

## Level 9:
*Naksh Karwalla*

A seemingly simple individual who seemed to bear a striking resemblance to the fictional character Goro Akechi. Putting on the facade of being a cheerful, religious person who was adorned by everyone at the Superposition Research Facility, he bore the trauma of wanting to exact revenge on those who originally stole his research for their benefit. It seemed that even after managing those individuals, his hate for the research continued to grow, as he employed more and more cruel tactics to get his job done.

He also seemed to love writing novels about the different plans he had, encrypting his plans for his subordinates cleverly, which made it easy for them to decrypt while also keeping it hidden from the general crowd who had found these stories.

Poems, stories, and the comments he made on different subreddits, it was possible that he was reporting to someone bigger. The ringleader of this entire operation, and someone who was controlling everyone's positions in the story, and someone close to the entire story from the beginning, but the team never wanted to investigate.

The CEO of the main branch of Recherche de Superposition...

Superposition Research Facilities.

## Level 10:
Nocturne, Silhouette, Iridescence, Poluture, Ragna, etc.
All different operation names that were discovered...

That the team manages to link to one person: **Vedika Duruvalla**

The Player finds her LeetCode account and tried to uncover the real reason why she was hosting this massive terrorist attack. The team scrolls through her Tumblr, her sites, her blogs, literally everything that they can find on the net to piece together a singular evidence.
The evidence that she was the main person responsible for the death of Ashna Shah. Something, if proven, will allow the team to use the other evidence to put all the above individuals into prison for the deeds that they have done.

The other senior member informs the officers to call the Task Force and Central Bureau of Investigation, convincing them to begin hunting these individuals down while enough evidence is finally gathered.

Mira, who is still kept in the room for questioning, is taken by the Investigation Bureau for more questioning, and the Cell now tries its best to find the final piece to the puzzle. The name of the operation that killed Ashna Shah.

While trying to discover, they realised the true intent of these killing operations for Vedika...
Everything boiled down to the fact that she was hunting individuals who posed a threat to her own team's research in Quantum Physics. A deal so dire that it made her kill people and bring down those who stood against her.

Insanity seemed to have piqued her interest, as she completely gave up on sanity, trying to take down those who were against her. Had Maya managed to clean up the body, another victim would have been called missing, and nothing would have been found out.

Suddenly, everything made sense to the team.
- Mira was the therapist to whom everyone was assigned to deal with Post-Grief Disorder. She was also the person who could be easily blamed, and thus, they kept her in the team.
- Arjun and his team were part of the hitman squad in charge of the main killings.
- Maya was the janitor who made sure that there was no evidence for Forensics to clean up and find out the operation.
- Naksh was the person who made sure to contact everyone and made the entire operation possible.
- Finally, Vedika was the person who was heading the entire operation. Giving tasks and roles to everyone involved in this entire incident.

As soon as the Player finishes pinning all these details onto the board, the intern comes rushing to the Player with the last remaining puzzle piece.

The name of the operation that killed Ashna:
`Singularity`

The team starts to howl with excitement, as they quickly realise that they have just solved one of the biggest mafia cases in the entire country, taking down an entire research-based syndicate.

The team rushes to the headquarters and presents the evidence.

## Epilogue:
Thus, with that, the countless sleepless hours that they spent on the operation were complete. They sit back and marvel at their progress... eagerly awaiting the newspapers the following day, revealing all the information that they found to the public. And arresting these individuals.

*"Congratulations on helping us stop this national-level threat from spiralling out of control"*

*All they can do is patiently wait...*



## *To you, the player:*
**Congratulations on arresting the following individuals:**

- **Mira Shukla**
- **Arjun Bhujiawalla and his team**
- **Maya Mannaravalappil and her team**
- **Naksh Karwalla**
- **Vedika Duruvalla**
