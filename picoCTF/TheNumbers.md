On clicking the numbers, a file downloads that has the name `the_numbers.png`

In this file, we can clearly see that this is just the conversion of their alphabet to their number form. The only main thing with this, is that we will need to extract the numbers first.

Therefore, I went to google lens and extracted the numbers from there, and then I went to a converter site *(I could have written a program to do the same, but that would have wasted more time.)*...

And after 2 mins of digging, viola, I found the answer.
