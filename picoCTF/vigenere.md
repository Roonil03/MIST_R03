In this challenge, we had to simply just take the text cipher and decrypt it, the key was also present in the question statement itself.<br>
![s16141211032024](https://a.okmd.dev/md/672753ff2337b.png)

Using the cipher and the key, it was easy for me to figure out a way to get the answer:
#### Cipher text:
```
rgnoDVD{O0NU_WQ3_G1G3O3T3_A1AH3S_cc82272b}
```
#### Key:
```
"CYLABS"
```

### Answer:
```
picoCTF{D0NT_US3_V1G3N3R3_C1PH3R_ae82272q}
```
